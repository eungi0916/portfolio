            <h1 class="news1-h1">Jurgen Klopp explains decision to let Takumi Minamino leave on loan to Southampton</h1>
            <p>Jurgen Klopp admitted he would have ‘loved’ to keep Takumi Minamino at Liverpool for the rest of the season, but the opportunity for him to get regular playing time at Southampton was too good to resist.</p>
            <p>Klopp signed the Japan international from Red Bull Salzburg 12 months ago, but he has struggled to make a serious impact – scoring four goals in 31 matches in all competitions. The intense competition in Klopp’s forward line has restricted the number of opportunities Minamino has been allowed but Klopp still views him as a ‘long-term project’. Liverpool would not allow Southampton to insert an option to buy clause in the transfer deadline day deal and Klopp expects Minamino, 22, to return with much needed game time in order to further develop.
            </p>
            <p>‘Yeah, of course, having options makes it the only chance that you can give a player to another club,’ said Klopp. ‘When Southampton asked it wasn’t that we said “no, no, no chance”, we thought about it and Takumi is an incredibly good player and we didn’t give him enough chances. That’s the truth.</p>
            <p>‘That’s for different reasons, sometimes it was just the size – because of our problems in defence we weren’t tall enough and then Takumi on the pitch and I think, “how can we do that?”, defending set pieces is a very important part. ‘In some moments these kind of things make the difference why one player is playing and the other not. ‘So when Southampton came up, there were not a lot of clubs where I thought it made really sense to let him go but Southampton makes a lot of sense. ‘He’s there for 17 days now. In the situation Southampton is, I think if Takumi stays fit he will have a good chance to play 17 games, which helps everybody. It helps Southampton, it helps us.</p>

        <h1 class="news2-h1">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reveals why Edinson Cavani was taken off at half-time of Southampton trouncing</h1>
        <div class="news2-article">
        <p class="news2-p">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed he took Edinson Cavani off at half-time of Manchester United’s 9-0 demolition of Southampton as a precaution after the striker picked up a knock. Cavani got on the scoresheet with an expert header as the Red Devils strolled to a Premier League record-equalling victory at Old Trafford against nine-man Saints. Alexandre Jankewitz was sent off for a horror challenge on Scott McTominay after just 79 seconds and Jan Bednarek was also given his marching orders late on as a rampant United made their opponents suffer.
        Goals from Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Marcus Rashford and Cavani, as well as an own goal from Bednarek, gave United a 4-0 lead going into half-time.</p>
        <p class="news2-p">In the second half, further strikes from McTominay, Bruno Fernandes, Dan James and a brace from Cavani’s replacement, Anthony Martial, saw United register their biggest win in the Premier League since beating Ipswich Town by the same scoreline 26 years ago. After the game, Solskjaer admitted a strong tackle on Cavani’s ankle was the reason the Uruguayan was substituted at half-time. ‘He was good but he got a bad tackle on his ankle so there was no point taking any risks,’ Solskjaer told BT Sport. ‘So hopefully it won’t swell up too much.’</p>
        <p class="news2-p">The Red Devils moved level on points with league leaders Manchester City following the emphatic win, and Solskjaer was excited over the ‘magic’ on display from his side. ‘We shared the goals between the players,’ the Norwegian boss added. ‘When the game starts like it does it’s always if you can get the first goal as we have seen so many examples of 10 men closing up shop and getting a draw. ‘We’ve been waiting for them to show the magic and it was a night for them to go and enjoy it. We’ve not had many times where we could just enjoy the second half. ‘You get lots of confidence from a performance like this, scoring goals is always good for a team.’</p>
